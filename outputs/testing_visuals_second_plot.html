penetration of high salinity waters and which are shallow ( e. g. , Blackwater, Severn).","Downland estuaries are narrow with fast freshwater runoff, short inland penetrat ion of salt water, strongly tidal and turbid, but do not contain extensive feeding areas for sea bass (e. g. , Arun, Itchen).","Sandy estuaries are produced by river deposits, often have dunes or saltmarshes along the tidal reaches, and juvenile sea bass may d ominate fish communities ( e. g. , Nevern, Burry Inlet).","Rias are valleys that have been flooded by the sea, have rocky areas, little sediment, and larger areas of deep water that may contain juvenile and adult sea bass throughout the year ( e. g. , Fal, Yealm).","Natural harbours are tidal non -estuarine arms of the sea that are usually shallow and have large intertidal areas that may contain sea bass ( e. g. , Poole and Chichester Harbours).","Methods developed to predict fish assemblages in estuaries identified latitu de, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, habitat,  and mud as important factors in explaining the occurrence of sea bass  in estuaries in Portugal, but the predictive ability was limited as the models only explained around
